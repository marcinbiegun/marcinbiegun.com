title: About
---

I'm a pragmatic software developer with experience in delivering and
Ruby on Rails MVPs and scalable Ruby microservices. I'm familiar with
deploying and maintaning applications on Linux severs and writing
front-end interfaces using Backbone.js and React.js.

Recently I'm learning QuartzComposer, Cyril and other tools for coding
engaging 3D animations.
