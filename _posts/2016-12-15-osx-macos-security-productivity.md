I was pretty impressed that my previous OSX install had served me for
4 years of heavy software development and daily personal use.

But a time has come for a fresh system reinstall.
During the setup, I had some troubles
remembering all useful system settings and tweaks I've made, so here's
the list for my future reference, and possible use for other power users.

### Apps

### Utility Apps

* [Karabinier](https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner-Elements) - a tool for remapping keys
  * Disable CapsLock
  * Switch `right command` with `right alt` for easier access to polish diacritic chars
* [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com) (free or $25) - application launcher and a swiss army knife
  * Bind `CMD + F1`, `CMD + F2`, etc. to app activate, my most used apps are Chrome, MacVim and iTerm
  * Some custom scripts, e.g. "j GR-123" command to open Jira ticket
* [Spectacle](https://www.spectacleapp.com/) - simple window manager, organize windows using keyboard
  * `Option + Command + F` to maximize active window
  * `Option + Command + ‚Üê` to move window to the left part of the screen
* [KeepingYouAwake](https://github.com/newmarcel/KeepingYouAwake) - puts a coffe cup icon on menu bar, clicking it prevets your Mac from going to sleep for an hour (modern version of Caffeine app)
* [Flux](https://justgetflux.com) - prevents your eyes from being burned in late hours
* [MenuMeters](http://member.ipmu.jp/yuji.tachikawa/MenuMetersElCapitan/) - displays system metrics (CPU, memory, network, disk usage) on menu bar
  * quickly identify anomalies like zombie apps taking 100% of CPU power
* [Boom2](http://www.globaldelight.com/boom/index.php) ($13) - system-wide audio equalizer
* [BrightnessMenulet](https://github.com/superduper/BrightnessMenulet) - software controls for monitor brightness

### Security Apps

  * [1Password](https://1password.com/) ($65 or $3/month) - fully featured and good looking
  password manager
  * [ClamXav](https://www.clamxav.com/) ($30) - open-source antivirus, useful
  for scanning apps from not trusted sources
  * [LittleSnitch](https://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/index.html) ($30) - firewall, it requires you to set rules for any new Internet connections
    * Detect suspicious connections
    * Block unnecessary analytics/tracking connections
  * [TorBrowser](https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en) - the simplest way to be sure you are using TOR correcly is to have a dedicated TOR browser
  * [GPG Suite](https://gpgtools.org/) - GUI tools making using GPG email and files encryption easy, integrates with Mail.app
  * [Coherence](http://www.bzgwebs.com/coherence) ($3) - encapsulates webapps as Mac apps
  * [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome) with my favorite plugins:
    * [Disconnect](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/disconnect/jeoacafpbcihiomhlakheieifhpjdfeo) - disables tracking/analytics/ad-network scripts
    * [AdBblock](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adblock/gighmmpiobklfepjocnamgkkbiglidom) - disables ads
    * [Signal](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/signal-private-messenger/bikioccmkafdpakkkcpdbppfkghcmihk) - safe communication

    * [Bookolio](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bookolio/lbgmbgopjppdjfopndcniomnhpodajba) - displays a nice list of bookmarks in empty tabs, I like it better than having the bookmarks bar always visible
    * [Linkclump](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/linkclump/lfpjkncokllnfokkgpkobnkbkmelfefj) - enables you select multiple URLs and copy them or open in multiple tabs
