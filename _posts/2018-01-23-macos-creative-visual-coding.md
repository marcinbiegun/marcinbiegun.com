# Intro

In this article I want to present an simple opinionated setup for visual
creative coding on macOS.

I've spent myself too much time exploring the possibilities before
actually making something, so here's my setup that should be good as a
starting point.

I'm focusing on generative, live rendered visuals, like in 3d games - 
I think it's more fun for prorammers and it's GPUs areonly getting
stronger (and cheper). But I'm
also including crucial video-related helper tools, which will help with
composing a video file.

## Types of software you need

There at least a few categories of software related to
visual creative coding:

  * VJ tools / media servers
  * visual/text programming toolkits - deliver fast, learn concepts
  * livecoding tools
  * plugins / effects
  * graphic tools like Blender or FinalCutProX

Start simple. Especiall if you don't have a lot of graphics bachground
- it's good to produce results fast. That way you'll learn the basic concepts faster.
Then if you

Coding: cyril / libecodelab, Processing, Shaders
Patching: TouchDesigner
Composition: VDMX / FinalCutProX
