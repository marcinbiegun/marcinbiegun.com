### Fastmail.fm

+ not google ecosystem
+ service / client separation
+ nice features: calendar, email, dav + good apps
+ not trying to sell your data
+ based in Australia
- price?

* Basic plan?

I highly recommend FastMail as a email provider service. Actually it
includes many more services, wich provides a kind of "personal cloud" -
but with old good service/client serparation. No locking customer's in.

FM is just a service provider, you use client aplicatins on
mobile/destop devices.
